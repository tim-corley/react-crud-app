```

3. Start browser-sync to launch site

## React Context API

[Offical Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

Avoid "prop drilling"! Instead, share/pass data around the application without sending through each intermediate component between the parent and child.

## React Hooks

[Offical Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

Use state within functional components!

## Roadmap / To-Do

See the [open issues](https://github.com/tim-corley/react-crud-app/issues) for a list of proposed features and/or improvements (as well as any known issues).
